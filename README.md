# Elevate Healthcare - Interactive Service Territory Map

Interactive US/Canada map and optimization model for service coverage, travel cost, and hiring scenarios.

- Live map: https://hockeysnipes8989-sudo.github.io/elevate-territory-map/
- Repo: https://github.com/hockeysnipes8989-sudo/elevate-territory-map

## What This Includes

1. Map layers for active-contract assets, appointments, technicians, territories, and airports.
2. Optimization scenario panel on the map for `N=0..4` new hires.
3. End-to-end MILP pipeline for travel + hiring economics.
4. Hybrid travel-cost engine built from Navan flight data.
5. BTS-calibrated cost matrix (Step 10) replacing speculative airport benchmarks with government fare data + 1.22× corporate premium.

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Recommended runtime in this environment:

```bash
/opt/miniconda3/bin/python3 ...
```

## Standard Map Pipeline (Steps 1-5)

```bash
python scripts/01_clean_data.py
python scripts/02_geocode.py
python scripts/03_match_install_base.py
python scripts/04_build_territories.py
python scripts/05_generate_map.py
```

Source files for steps 1-4 are expected in `data/raw/`. Geocoding cache lives in `data/geocode_cache.json`.

## Optimization Pipeline (Steps 6-11)

Outputs are written to `data/processed/optimization/`.

```bash
python scripts/06_build_optimization_inputs.py
python scripts/07_build_travel_cost_model.py --engine hybrid --min-direct-route-n 5 --shrinkage-k 10
python scripts/10_correct_travel_costs.py
python scripts/11_build_full_cost_table.py
python scripts/08_optimize_locations.py --min-new-hires 0 --max-new-hires 4 --max-hires-per-base 1 --time-limit-sec 600
python scripts/09_analyze_scenarios.py
python scripts/05_generate_map.py
```

Step 10 (BTS calibration) only needs to re-run when `travel_cost_matrix.csv` changes. Toggle `BTS_CORRECTED_MATRIX` in `scripts/config.py` to switch between matrices without re-running.

Step 10 requires a manually-produced `travel_cost_audit_report.xlsx` in the optimization directory. This file is not generated by any pipeline script.

Step 11 pre-computes a per-(tech/candidate, node) cost table with drive/fly classification, rental car, and hotel costs. Toggle `FULL_COST_MODEL` in `scripts/config.py` to switch between full-cost and flight-only models.

Default external workbook paths are in `scripts/config.py` (overridable via env vars
`ELEVATE_APPTS_SOURCE`, `ELEVATE_TECH_SOURCE`, `ELEVATE_NAVAN_SOURCE`):

- `EXTERNAL_APPOINTMENTS_XLSX`
- `EXTERNAL_TECH_ROSTER_XLSX`
- `EXTERNAL_NAVAN_XLSX`

## Current Model Rules (Important)

- Annual burdened planning cost per incremental new hire: `146,640` USD.
- Unmet demand penalty: `5,000` USD per appointment (`DEFAULT_UNMET_PENALTY_USD`).
- Out-of-region soft penalty default: `0.0` USD (disabled by default).
- Canada coverage rule:
  - Techs flagged `constraint_canada_wide=1` (Hakim policy) are Canada-only.
  - Canada demand nodes can only be assigned to those Canada-wide techs.
  - New hires are blocked from Canada demand in current model.
- Canceled/voided travel handling:
  - Not optimized per scenario.
  - Added as a fixed baseline constant from Navan `Report` tab to every scenario.
- Contractor scope defaults to `texas_only` unless explicitly overridden.
- New-hire concentration cap defaults to `1` per base (`--max-hires-per-base 1`).
- Current verified technician roster is 16 total (including both HTX contractors).
- Technician markers are grouped by shared base location (popup lists all names at that base).

## Travel Cost Engine (Steps 7 + 10)

**Step 7** builds the raw hybrid matrix (`travel_cost_matrix.csv`). Default mode is `--engine hybrid`.

- Inputs: Navan `Clean Flights` + `Report`.
- Training rows: non-management, `TICKETED`, valid origin/destination, positive paid amount.
- Hybrid route estimate logic:
  - Use empirical direct-route information when support is strong.
  - Blend empirical + model prediction using shrinkage for strong direct routes.
  - For sparse routes, blend model prediction with heuristic estimate using support-based weights.
  - Apply guardrails so sparse predictions cannot collapse to unrealistic near-zero fares.
  - Optional BTS prior for low-confidence US gaps.
  - Final fallback to legacy heuristic if needed.
- Diagnostics written:
  - `travel_model_metrics.json`
  - `travel_model_feature_importance.csv`
  - `travel_matrix_coverage_report.json`
  - `bts_prior_coverage_report.json`
  - `travel_matrix_origin_anomaly_report.json`
  - `dropped_zero_fare_flights.csv`

Legacy mode remains available: `--engine heuristic`.

**Step 10** corrects the raw matrix with BTS government fares (`travel_cost_matrix_bts_corrected.csv`).

- Embeds BTS Q2 2025 itinerary fares ÷ 2 × 1.22 corporate premium for 62 US airports + 6 Canadian airports (×2.0 cross-border multiplier).
- Blends BTS benchmarks with Navan actuals by data density (0–4 flights → 80% BTS; 5–9 → 60% BTS; 10–19 → 40% BTS; 20+ → Navan only).
- Per-route override: routes with ≥5 Navan flights use observed actuals directly.
- Audit log written to `cost_correction_log.csv` (one row per origin airport).

## Scenario Cost Formula

Step 8 computes:

- `modeled_total_cost_usd = travel_cost_usd + out_of_region_penalty_usd + hire_cost_usd + unmet_penalty_usd`
- `economic_total_with_overhead_usd = modeled_total_cost_usd + baseline_canceled_voided_usd`

Where:

- `hire_cost_usd = (number of incremental new hires) * 146,640`
- `baseline_canceled_voided_usd` is fixed from Navan baseline data

## Latest Baseline Snapshot (Current Repo Outputs)

From the latest committed optimization artifacts (BTS-corrected matrix + full cost model active):

- Navan canceled/voided baseline constant: `35,632.02` USD
- Scenario window: `N=0..4`
- Best scenario: `N=0`
- N=0 total with overhead: `1,287,451.57` USD *(includes hotel $399 + rental $235 per fly trip)*
- N=0 travel cost: `1,251,819.55` USD
- Hard cap result: no scenario allocates more than 1 hire to the same base
- All 5 scenarios solved to proven optimality (MIP gap = 0.0)
- All 1,480 appointments served across all scenarios (zero unmet)
- Active techs at N=0: 15 (one tech has `availability_fte=0.0`)
- Target utilization: 85% (demand-normalized capacity model)

### Scenario Results

| N | Travel | Payroll | Overhead | Total |
|---|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| 0 | $1,251,819.55 | $0 | $35,632.02 | **$1,287,451.57** |
| 1 | $1,164,360.50 | $146,640 | $35,632.02 | $1,346,632.52 |
| 2 | $1,095,731.96 | $293,280 | $35,632.02 | $1,424,643.98 |
| 3 | $1,036,813.64 | $439,920 | $35,632.02 | $1,512,365.66 |
| 4 | $989,421.17 | $586,560 | $35,632.02 | $1,611,613.19 |

### Hiring Recommendations by Scenario

| N | Recommended Bases |
|---|-------------------|
| 1 | CLE (Cleveland, OH) |
| 2 | CLE, MKE (Milwaukee, WI) |
| 3 | BOS (Boston, MA), CLE, ORD (Chicago, IL) |
| 4 | BOS, CLE, ORD, Fort Smith AR (→ LIT airport) |

All scenarios cost more than N=0. Marginal travel savings diminish with each additional hire.

## Key Caveats

- Hotel cost is flat $399/trip (Navan 2.5-night average). Trip bundling is not modeled.
- Great-circle distance (not road distance) for drive/fly classification at 300 mi threshold.
- No seasonality — all appointments treated equivalently regardless of time of year.
- New hires cannot serve HPS nodes (policy constraint). 115 HPS appointments are served by existing certified techs.
- SHV and ICT travel costs use proxy airports (LIT and TUL respectively), not direct BTS-calibrated values.
- BTS fares are Q2 2025 data. Tier-2 airports (~24 of 68) use estimated midpoints.
